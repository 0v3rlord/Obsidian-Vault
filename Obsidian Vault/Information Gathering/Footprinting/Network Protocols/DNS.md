Not only links server names to IP addresses, but can contain additional information about services associated with a domain.

### DNS Server Types
There are 6 types of DNS servers.

| Server Type                    | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| ------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `DNS Root Server`              | The root servers of the DNS are responsible for the top-level domains (`TLD`). As the last instance, they are only requested if the name server does not respond. Thus, a root server is a central interface between users and content on the Internet, as it links domain and IP address. The [Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers](https://www.icann.org/) (`ICANN`) coordinates the work of the root name servers. There are `13` such root servers around the globe. |
| `Authoritative Nameserver`     | Authoritative name servers hold authority for a particular zone. They only answer queries from their area of responsibility, and their information is binding. If an authoritative name server cannot answer a client's query, the root name server takes over at that point.                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| `Non-authoritative Nameserver` | Non-authoritative name servers are not responsible for a particular DNS zone. Instead, they collect information on specific DNS zones themselves, which is done using recursive or iterative DNS querying.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| `Caching DNS Server`           | Caching DNS servers cache information from other name servers for a specified period. The authoritative name server determines the duration of this storage.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| `Forwarding Server`            | Forwarding servers perform only one function: they forward DNS queries to another DNS server.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| `Resolver`                     | Resolvers are not authoritative DNS servers but perform name resolution locally in the computer or router.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |

# Footprinting the Service

###### NS Query
```bash
dig ns inlanefreight.htb @DNS_SRV_ADDRESS
```

###### Version Query
```bash
dig CH TXT version.bind server_ip 
```

### [[Zone Transfer]]
- Zone transfer refers to the transfer of [[zones]] to another DNS server on port 53. The process is called **Asynchronous Full Transfer Zone (AXFR)**. A zone transfer is merely data being synchronized.
- Zone transfers are to synchronize slave DNS servers. 
- Using a secret **rndc-key**, DNS servers communicate with their master or slave.
- Original zone data is stored on the **primary** name server for the zone.

```bash
# Zone Transfer
dig axfr inlanefreight.htb @server_ip

# You could find internal subdomains, allowing an Internal Zone Transfer
dig axfr internal.inlanefreight.htb @server_ip
```

### Subdomain Brute Forcing
You can also use **dnsenum**.
```bash
for sub in $(cat /opt/useful/SecLists/Discovery/DNS/subdomains-top1million-110000.txt);do dig $sub.inlanefreight.htb @10.129.14.128 | grep -v ';\|SOA' | sed -r '/^\s*$/d' | grep $sub | tee -a subdomains.txt;done
```
